# Calendar Application

## Prerequisites for running
This project was created using [Angular](https://angular.dev/) and [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.2.0 for the front end, and [.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/9.0) version 9.0 for the back end.

## Running the back end locally

From the `CalendarAPI` folder, run:
```bash
dotnet run
```
This will open a browser window with a [Scalar](https://scalar.com/) UI, from where the API can be invoked.

## Building and running the front end

From the `calendar-client` folder, run:

```bash
npm install
```
Once the preceding operation has completed, run the front end with:

```bash
ng serve
```
Once the server is running, the application can be found at [http://localhost:4200/](http://localhost:4200/).
